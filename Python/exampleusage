#Example Usage for the python version of the code.
For the example, please the sky map provided in the link below:

It is converted from a fits file taken from the first two year study. 

# this first line will return the values of the integral at different observation time, assuming a telescope 
#can achieve limiting magnitude 22.5 in 10 secodns with a raidus of the aperture equal to 5 meters.

tau, prob = Pem(5, 22.5, 10, [], [], [], [], [], [])

# the second line will find the tiles in the sky using a greedy algorithm. 
# This line will find 50 tiles assuming the field of view of the telescope is 3 square meters.
# The resolution of the fits file is 8, and we want 90% credible region.

location, check, Prob_in_field = Greedy(3, 50, 'posterior_11366_2.txt', 8, 0.9)

# this third line will return an estimate of the total probability and the time allocation to each of the fields.
# This assumes the slew time of the telescope is 1 second and zero second for the readout using equal observation time
# If the use of Lagrange multiplier is intended to compute the individual exposure time, replace 'Eq' with 'LM'.
# But the dictionary 'options' in solver may need to be modified to ensure a reliable results.

tprob, time_allocation = Main(1800, 1, 0, Prob_in_field, tau, prob, 'Eq')
